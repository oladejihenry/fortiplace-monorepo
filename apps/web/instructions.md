# Project Overview

The **Creator Monetization Platform** enables African creators to sell digital products, manage sales, and receive payouts every two weeks (subject to a minimum balance). Each creator has a custom subdomain to list their content. Payments are processed via Paystack, with a 10% platform fee deducted per transaction.

You will be using Next.js 15, Shadcn, Tailwind, Lucid icon, and Laravel as the backend.
